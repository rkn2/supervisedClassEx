'''You can also evaluate the model using the score method, which for regressors returns
the R2 score. The R2 score, also known as the coefficient of determination, is a measure of
goodness of a prediction for a regression model, and yields a score thatâ€™s usually between 0
and 1. A value of 1 corresponds to a perfect prediction, and a value of 0 corresponds to a
constant model that just predicts the mean of the training set responses, y_train. The
formulation of R2 used here can even be negative, which can indicate anticorrelated
predictions.'''

print("Test set R^2: {:.2f}".format(reg.score(X_test, y_test)))

# Here, the score is 0.83, which indicates a relatively good model fit.

'''For our one-dimensional dataset, we can see what the predictions look like for all possible
feature values. To do this, we create a test dataset consisting of many points
on the x-axis, which corresponds to the single feature: '''

fig, axes = plt.subplots(1, 3, figsize=(15, 4))
# create 1,000 data points, evenly spaced between -3 and 3
line = np.linspace(-3, 3, 1000).reshape(-1, 1)

    n_neighbors, reg.score(X_train, y_train),
    reg.score(X_test, y_test)))
    ax.set_xlabel("Feature")
    ax.set_ylabel("Target")
axes[0].legend(["Model predictions", "Training data/target","Test data/target"], loc="best")

'''As we can see from the plot, using only a single neighbor, each point in the training set has
an obvious influence on the predictions, and the predicted values go through all of the data
points. This leads to a very unsteady prediction. Considering more neighbors leads to
smoother predictions, but these do not fit the training data as well.'''
